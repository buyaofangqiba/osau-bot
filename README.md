# O.S.A.U. Bot (Phase 1 Scaffold)

Scaffolded Node.js + TypeScript service for Phase 1 requirements:
- Discord linking and leadership approval flow (skeleton)
- API client for gge-tracker
- Postgres schema and migration runner
- Scheduled sync wiring and leadership command placeholders

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run migrate
npm run dev
```

## Current status

This repo contains implementation scaffolding and typed module boundaries.
Business logic is intentionally skeletal and ready for feature implementation.
